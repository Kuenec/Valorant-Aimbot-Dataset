## Overview  
This repository provides a dataset containing **10,000+ labeled head only class images** from Valorant, specifically designed for training AI aimbots. The dataset contains only head detection particularly for headshot focused aim only.   

## Download the Dataset  
You can download the dataset here:  
ðŸ”— [Valorant 10K Head Only Class Dataset (Roboflow)](https://universe.roboflow.com/kuenec/valorant-10k-head-only-class-aimbot-ukzjf)  

## Usage  
1. **Download** the dataset from the provided link.  
2. **Train** your model using your preferred framework (e.g., YOLOv5, YOLOv8, Faster R-CNN).  
3. **Deploy** the trained model into the game through the use of torch CUDA and torch.load the .pt file you get after training.  

### Recommendations  
- I personally trained my model using **YOLOv5**, but it is compatible with most object detection frameworks.
- Augment (blur, flip, crop) some of the images, to prevent your bot from memeorizing the locations of heads, stunting progression of the bot.
